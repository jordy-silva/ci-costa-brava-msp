# Regata Costa Brava Website

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

**FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY**

This website serves as information platform about the race to interested participants. It gives a brief description of the race course, shows the pricing of the different packages and what's included in each of them as well as a form to directly sign-up for the race. It also serves as platform for the race sponsors to showcase their support.
 
## UX
 
**User Stories**.

- As organization, I want to give all information about the race, so I can get people interested
- As skipper, I want to know prices so I can decide if I want to participate
- As skipper, I want an easy way to sign-up so I can 
- As a Sponsor, I want my company to be shown to visitors so I can get a positive ROI
- As aficionado, I want centralized access to all social media, so I can follow the event

**Wireframes**
For the skeleton element of the UX design of this project, the [balsamiq.cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud)tool was used to create the wireframe. The wireframe can be [viewed here.](https://jordy-silva.github.io/ci-costa-brava-msp/assets/wireframes/desktop.png)

## Features

The site is responsive and mobile first, with lighter code being loaded for small devices due to the elimination of some images from the design.

A scrollspy feature from Bootstrap is also used in the navigation menu to provide a visual indication of the section of the website that is being viewed.

### Features Left to Implement
- The form should validate the email entered is in a valid format
- The form could direct to a payments gateway to make the payment

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (v4.3.1) https://getbootstrap.com


## Testing

The site has been tested in multiple browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox), in multiple OS (OSx, Linux, Windows 10) and on multiple mobile devices (Android 7 phone & iPad mini) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

All links have been tested and all the ones linking to external websites open in a blank tab.

All user stories have been checked to confirm the website offers a solution to them.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html

To run locally, you can clone this repository by pasting git clone https://github.com/hschafer2017/HSCHAFER-Portfolio.git into your terminal, given that git is installed in your machine.
